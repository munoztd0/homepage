## Hello, I'm David! {{< fa hand-wave >}}

I'm a data scientist and computational neuroscientist who loves solving complex problems at the intersection of science, technology, and human behavior. My journey has taken me from neuroscience research to building data solutions for pharmaceutical companies and fintech startups.

By day, I craft scalable RShiny applications, deploy machine learning models, and build data pipelines that transform raw information into actionable insights. I'm particularly passionate about Bayesian methods and their application to real-world challengesâ€”whether that's understanding customer behavior, detecting fraud, or modeling risk.

When I'm not immersed in code or data, you'll find me advocating for open science, contributing to rOpenSci packages, or mentoring the next generation of data scientists. I believe in the power of data to drive positive change, and I'm always looking for opportunities to apply my skills toward meaningful impact.

### What drives me

{{< fa code >}} Building elegant solutions to messy problems  
{{< fa ranking-star >}} Applying Bayesian thinking to uncertain worlds  
{{< fa cubes >}} Architecting robust data infrastructure  
{{< fa brain >}} Understanding the computational basis of behavior  
{{< fa circle-nodes >}} Connecting ideas across disciplines  
{{< fa scale-balanced >}} Finding balance between rigor and practicality

### Beyond the data

{{< fa utensils >}} Culinary explorer and home chef  
{{< fa person-biking >}} Avid cyclist  
{{< fa water >}} Weekend surfer  
{{< fa plane-departure >}} Global traveler  
{{< fa book-open-reader >}} Perpetual learner

Let's connect and explore how we might collaborate on projects that matter!
