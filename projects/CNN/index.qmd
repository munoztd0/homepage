#  Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

The goal of this project was to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

I used python and keras interface from tensorflow to build a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify dog breeds. The model was trained on the [Dog Breed Identification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data). The dataset contains 8351 dog images and 133 breeds.
