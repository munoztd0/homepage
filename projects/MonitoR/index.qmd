# Know thyself

Keeping track of the number of users on your Shiny Server is helpful for several reasons:

-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Identifies low-traffic periods (best times to push updates or restart the server).
-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Tells you if you need to pay more attention to scaling your apps (i.e. adjust server size, optimize slow apps).
-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Shows which apps are most popular.
-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Basic architecture.
-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Deploy Shiny Server Open Source with one or more apps.
-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Continuously check your server's logs and save off data on the number of users on each app (check_server.R plus a cronjob).
-   {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} Use Shiny to display the data over time.
