# Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks

I collaborated on the Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks library [hBayesDM](https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM/), a user-friendly package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational models on an array of decision-making tasks.

It uses [STAN](https://mc-stan.org/) for Bayesian inference and supports both {R} and {Python}. hBayesDM's goal is to help interpreting experimental data through computational models using a full Bayesian statistical inference approach with MCMC sampling.
My work involved the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm for reinforcement learning tasks.
