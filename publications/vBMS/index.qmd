# Voxels-wise Bayesian model selection

Is a technique to compare brain maps using Bayesian methods.

Building and comparing brain maps between several models is a common task for neuroscientist.

Here we performed a Bayesian model selection (BMS) to select the best model given the data for group-level analysis. This procedure computes the probability of the data given the model (model evidence) for a set of candidate models. It also allows to compare characterize maps"heat zones" and to visualize them.
