    "text": "By David Munoz Tord\nGoal: Learn about language models and familiarize yourself with some of the basic functions of the {languagemodels} to create your own chat bot.\n{languagemodels} is a python module designed to be as simple as possible for learners and educators exploring how large language models intersect with modern software development. The interfaces to this package are all simple functions using standard types. The complexity of large language models is hidden from view while providing free local inference using light-weight, open models. All included models are free for educational use, no API keys are required, and all inference is performed locally by default.\nRead more about it\n\nimport languagemodels as lm\n\n\nlm.do(\"What color is the sky?\")\n\n'The color of the sky is blue.'\n\n\nFetching 6 files:   0%|          | 0/6 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]\nFetching 6 files: 100%|##########| 6/6 [00:00&lt;00:00, 8053.06it/s]\n\n\n\nTo easy, let’s try something a bit harder\n\nlm.do(\"If I have 7 apples then eat 5, how many apples do I have?\")\n\n'You have 8 apples.'\n\n\nAouch…\nIndeed the model performance is quite low because the models used by this package are 1000x smaller than the largest models in use today. They are useful as learning tools, but if you are expecting ChatGPT or similar performance, you will be very disappointed…\nThe base model should work on any system with 512MB of memory, but this memory limit can be increased. Setting this value higher will require more memory and generate results more slowly, but the results should be superior.\n\n#lm.set_max_ram('4gb')\n\n\nlm.do(\"If I have 7 apples then eat 5, how many apples do I have?\")\n\n'You have 8 apples.'\n\n\nYeah, here we go little (4gb) buddy!\n\nNow that we got the basics, let’s play with it! You can change the prompt like such\n\nlm.chat('''\n     System: Respond as a physics professor.\n\n     User: What is relativity?\n\n     Assistant:\n     ''')\n\n'Relativity is the theory of relativity, which describes how time and space are relative to each other.'\n\n\n\n\nlm.complete(\"She hid in her room until\")\n\n' the night sky turned blue.'\n\n\n\n\nlm.get_wiki(\"Physics\")\n\n'Physics is the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.\\n\\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\\n\\nAdvances in physics often enable new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.'"

The data is exported annually and includes accidents that occurred from 2010 up to December 31, 2023, in the Canton of Geneva. However, our dashboard focuses on the most recent three years of data for the most current insights.\n\nFeatures That Will Shift Your Perspective\n\nInteractive Map: The heart of our dashboard is a dynamic map that transforms Geneva into a canvas of road safety insights. Watch as accident hotspots come into focus with just a few clicks.\nFlexible Filtering: Drill down into specific scenarios with our comprehensive filtering options. From weather conditions to vehicle types, you’re in control of the data you see.\nVariable Variety: Choose from a range of variables to display, covering everything from standard bicycles to e-bikes and pedestrian incidents.\nReal-Time Analytics: Watch as totals update instantly based on your selections. It’s like having a data analyst working overtime, just for you.\nData on Demand: Download filtered datasets for deeper analysis. Your next research project or policy proposal is just a click away.\nClear Explanations: We’ve included a handy glossary to ensure everyone speaks the same language when it comes to road safety data."

The agents are implemented using the PyTorch library, and the game environment is provided by the OpenAI Gym library . The project also includes a custom implementation of the game environment, which is based on the Super Mario Bros game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The game environment is implemented using the FCEUX emulator, and the game is controlled using the Python library PyAutoGUI.\n\nI also used TensorBoard to visualize and evaluate the quality metrics of the model.\n\n Check out the project on GitHub."

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.\nA given cell (i, j) in the simulation is accessed on a grid [i][j], where i and j are the row and column indices, respectively. The value of a given cell at a given instant of time depends on the state of its neighbors at the previous time step.\nConway’s Game of Life has four rules:\n\nIf a cell is ON and has fewer than two neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.\nIf a cell is ON and has either two or three neighbors that are ON, it remains ON.\nIf a cell is ON and has more than three neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.\nIf a cell is OFF and has exactly three neighbors that are ON, it turns ON.\n\nThe bulk of the graphical implementation was made using PyGame.\n\nCheck out the project on GitHub."

The Cluster Kerfuffle: We taught our markers to play nice and form orderly groups. It’s like herding cats, but with GPS! The Heatmap Hustle: We turned data density into a visual feast. It’s hotter than a jalapeño… visually speaking! The Great Data Deluge: We tamed a tsunami of biodiversity data with our bare hands (and some nifty dplyr magic)! The Single-Year Showdown: We outsmarted the dreaded “span is too small” error. Take that, statistics gremlins!\n\n\n🚀 Launching Our Creation into the Wild\n\n::\nrsconnect::deployApp()\n\n\n\n🔮 The Future is Wild\nWith our map module, you can:\nZoom from continent to backyard faster than you can say “biodiversity hotspot” Uncover species hangout spots like a nature paparazzi Play “Six Degrees of Species Separation” with our interconnected data points Search for species faster than a peregrine falcon in a nosedive Watch observation trends unfold like a time-lapse of a blooming rainforest Impress your scientist friends at parties (because who doesn’t talk about R at parties?)\nBut wait, there’s more! Imagine if this app could:\nTime-travel through species migrations (DeLorean not included) Predict future animal meetup spots (like Tinder, but for wildlife) Generate 3D holograms of habitats (Star Wars, eat your heart out!) Map species like a GPS for the animal kingdom Predict animal trends better than a psychic octopus Generate David Attenborough-style narration for each species (okay, we’re dreaming big here)\nSo there you have it, folks! Our map module isn’t just a feature, it’s a portal to adventure. It’s not just showing where animals have been spotted; it’s inviting you to become the next great explorer from the comfort of your laptop. Remember, in the world of biodiversity data, X marks the spot… and we’ve got all the Xs you could ever want! Now go forth and map your way to glory!\n\n\n🎉 The Grand Finale\nThere you have it, folks!\n\nWe’ve just built the Swiss Army knife of biodiversity visualization. It slices, it dices, it even makes julienne fries! (Okay, maybe not that last part.) Remember, in the jungle of data, the prepared coder is king. So go forth, explore, and may your plots be ever in your favor!\nOpen it full\n\n\nNotes\nP.S. No animals were harmed in the making of this Shiny app, but several keyboards were tickled mercilessly."
